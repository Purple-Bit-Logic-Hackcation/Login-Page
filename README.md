## THEME :
#### It is a project based on EdTech. A man without education is like a buiding without Foundation. During this pandemic it has become difficult for many students to get access to education. But this app is a complete solution to that problem which helps students to learn and grow. 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 

## AIM :
#### To make learning more intresting.😊

## IDEA:
It is a website for students which has a lot of features.
The features we want to include are:
1. It will have different classrooms for different subjects in which teachers can assign work to the students and can send link for meetings without giving their phone numbers.
2. Teacher's can mark attendance of the students and students can check their daily attendance from there. 👨‍🏫👩‍🏫
3. There will be different channels in that app which includes the following :
   - Creative Corner for students so that they can participate in them, which includes painting competitions, singing competitions, drama, crafts, article writing, etc for their development. 😎
   - A Career Guide/Coach in which they can see various career options after 12th. 📈
   - A Test which help them to decide that what stream they should choose after 10th.
   - Resources section in which user can find resources/study material of various subjects. 📚📖
   - Syllabus section which contains syllabus user have to cover. 📑
   - Timetable organizer for user's time management. ⏲⏳
   - Doubts section, where user can ask doubts. ❓❔


## RELEVANCE:
Due to covid-19  pandemic health crisis all schools and colleges are closed. Teaching and learning assessment are now conducted online and students suffer from stress and anxiety but our app is the platform where students and teachers can interact and continue their studies with amazing style and also enjoy weekly quiz and completion of creative skills like singing, dancing, gaming, drawing, crafting etc.This app also encourage  entrepreneurship  among students so that they can  confidently present their ideas and thinking.A place where one can build his/her self confidence.

## INNOVATION:
1. **CREATIVE CORNER**: We made this section to provide students a chance to participate in various competitions and thrive on their own terms and push their intelligence to its limit and grow. 🌈
2. **CAREER GUIDE**: This section is to provide guidance to students about necessary steps that should be taken for heading them towards a bright future.
It was really fun designing and drafting these sections of our project. 📈❌✔🤔
3. **COVID-19 Glimpses**: for creating awareness about the Corona Virus Disease. 
4. **3-D CLASSROOMS**: A classroom which uses Augmented Reality for creating 3-D models so that students can better understand the concepts.👨‍🏫
